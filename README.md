## 🚀 Features

- **Advanced Demand Forecasting**: Utilizes ensemble machine learning models to predict future demand with high accuracy
- **Inventory Optimization**: Automatically calculates optimal reorder points and economic order quantities (EOQ)
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Visualizes historical data, forecasts, and inventory projections
- **What-if Analysis**: Test different scenarios to optimize inventory levels and reduce costs
- **Batch Optimization**: Process all products simultaneously for efficient inventory management

## 📋 Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
